# Runing_Server
Setting up a server with Python code
____________________________________
With this system that I implemented, you no longer need to go to the desktop and run it every time you want to start the server. Using this code, you just need to give it the location of the code on the desktop and it will run it itself. Be careful, if it is not on the desktop, you can use ../ to go back and enter the destination.
